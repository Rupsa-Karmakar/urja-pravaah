# URJA PRAVAAH

## 🌱 Smart Hybrid Energy Harvester

**Solar • Wind • Piezoelectric • Real-time Monitoring Dashboard**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**URJA PRAVAAH** is a smart sustainability project focused on hybrid renewable energy harvesting. It collects energy from **three clean sources**:

* ☀️ **Solar Energy**
* 🍃 **Wind Energy**
* ⚡ **Piezoelectric Energy** (from footsteps/vibration)

The system combines these energy sources to create a highly efficient hybrid energy solution. All harvested energy is monitored live through a custom-built web dashboard named **URJA PRAVAAH**.

This project aims to promote sustainable, self-powered systems for the future smart cities.
